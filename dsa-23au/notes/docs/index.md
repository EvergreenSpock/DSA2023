# About This Course 

This course is designed for teaching at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington,
in the United States during Fall Quarter of 2023. The material for data structures and
algorithms is often requested, and included, in computer science curricula in colleges,
codeschools, online learning platforms, and bookshelves. In Neil Gaiman's novel *American Gods*,
the deities and spirits of Old World religions transform into real humans, sometimes with mundane
lives and jobs, when their believers bring them to America. Some lose favor to New Gods
of technology, some continue to grow in prestige, some quietly continue to serve.

Data structures and algorithms are like these spiritual constructs in the form of analytical tools.
Programmers need them to solve problems, and so they appear in every new programming langauge
from workhorses like C/C++, the expressive and dynamic Javascript and Python, the Java Virtual
Machine family of langauges, improved systems and tooling languages like Rust and Golang,
academic and research-oriented languages like Haskell and Ocaml. If they are not built into
the language as reserved keywords, they manifest as a standard library that is included in 
most distributions, or they appear in third-party libraries as the community seeks to advance
their language and experiment with the right programming metaphors and idioms.

Structured data and algorithmic processing are

The needs I see fall into
three broad categories, and often people have more than one of them:

* An attraction to ordered and disciplined thinking. People have been performing
tasks 
* To prepare for and pass technical interviews to get a job
