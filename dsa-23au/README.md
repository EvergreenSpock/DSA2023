# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Students taking DSA this quarter are on two tracks, which run parallel with frequent
interaction via pair programming and mentorship.

* First-time DSA students will be responsible for completing
* Returning DSA students will be responsible for setting their own learning curriculum.

## Choice of Programming Language

All students can choose which programming language to use to complete this quarter.
The teaching staff can provide full support for Java, building on students' experience from Computer Science Foundations.

However, learning is an adventure, and there are a diverse array of programming languages,
each with a different lens on computation. You are welcome to choose any programming language
which can accept text input piped to `stdin` and returning an output on `stdout`, the two standard streams
in a UNIX shell, as this is how we will be testing your solutions. Don't worry,
99% of programming languages out there offer this feature.

## Software Setup

### Cloud IDE 
We will be using GitPod, a online integrated development environment (IDE) that can be
accessed from any web browser, allowing you to easily work on lab computers or on your
home machines.

There is free plan allowing up to 50 hours per month of use if you create and link
your [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) account. You may wish to do this to connect
with alumni, recruiters, or professionals in the field or specialty that you are
interested in working in.

Answer some preliminary questions about our use of Gitpod for this class.
You can adjust your answers to suit your preferences, it won't affect your development experience.
